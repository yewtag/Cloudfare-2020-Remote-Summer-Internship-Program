Gaming industry has been booming for the past few years, with an estimated net worth of around US$ 152 billon (Kaplan, 2019). In addition, due to the current Covid-19 pandemic, there are more people turning to gaming to either alleviate stress or even to occupy themselves due to various movement control measures imposed by different government. According to Statista, from March 16 to March 22 2020, like-for-like games sales have increased by 44%, further suggesting that many people were turning to video gaming to keep them entertained through the crisis (Gough, 2020). Inadvertently, the increased traffic demand to the game servers will no doubt require more resources and time to maximise its output and efficiency.

Most games developers nowadays built games that require an active network connection to game servers and this game servers have to be deployed worldwide to reduce latency experienced by players from all over the world. For example, popular games such as the League of Legends on computers to Clash Royale on mobile devices are examples that require constant connection to game servers. Worldwide online gaming traffic reached 915 petabytes per month in 2016 and is expected to grow by 79% more in 2019 (Cisco Systems, 2017). In addition, the roll-out of cloud gaming services such as GeForce Now and Google Stadia further indicate future gaming trends that is based on multiplayers and require fast, smooth, low latency to provide the best gaming experiences to players all around the world.

However, the increased traffic during this pandemic had caused various problems for cloud gaming services such as long queues, restricted access, low resolution gaming and input lag (Boddy, 2020). Latency and responsiveness are the chief obstacles which challenge the full-scale rise to cloud gaming, for both the cloud gaming community and game developers (Loftus, 2019). Cloud gaming will change and revolutionise how people game as currently users are the one that maintains and upgrades their own personal computers or devices in order to play games locally. In addition, the processing are all done locally. This is where cloud gaming comes in, it process and stream the games from the servers back to the users devices or computers, thus eliminating the need for users to constantly upgrade to be able to play resource intensive games. However, this proves to be a challenging and complicated task as multiple factors will affect the end users’ quality of experience such as distance from servers, implementation costs and etc. 

I believe the implementation of cloud computing will definitely affect its future and also the future of gaming. Big-scaled centralised data centres will have to change to multiple satellite data centres (Brandon, 2007) in order to better reap the benefits of distancing among users and minimising the impacts of a catastrophe. This can ensure that latency experienced by different players would not be too different and may result in a more level playing field. In addition, the servers located at various cities and countries will not be affected by natural disasters or catastrophe in one particular region or area, still maintaining the uptime. Although Cloudfare has quite a reasonable spread of data centres across 200 cities in 90 countries (Cloudfare), I believed that more could be done in such areas to improve and increase adoption. One major concern for companies would be the cost involved as satellite data centres generally cost more than a centralised one.

Cloudfare Workers has strongly emphasised the importance of ease of use for developers. One good example is the ability for game developers to write code in Javascript, Rust, C and C++. However, in my opinion, more could be done for budding game developers that might not be as well-versed in such programming languages. One way to improve adoption rate is to include more programming languages that are commonly used by gaming developers around the world such as Java, HTML5, CSS3, SQL and etc (GameDesigning, 2020). However, one major pitfalls of such a measure would be the need of hiring more talented programmers to make the Cloudfare Workers.

In conclusion, I am optimistic about the future of cloud gaming and how Cloudfare would be able to play a part in it. Various solutions have to be deployed in order for cloud gaming to really take off and become mainstream.
